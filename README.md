## 🔎 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete, industry-standard data analytics workflow using retail customer transaction data.  

The goal of the project is to transform raw retail data into meaningful business insights through:

- Data loading and cleaning in Python  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- SQL-based business querying  
- Interactive Power BI dashboard development  
- Executive-level reporting and presentation  

This project reflects the real-world responsibilities of a Data Analyst, covering the full analytics lifecycle from raw data to decision-ready insights.
